## Overview

This project is an R Notebook analysis designed to explore, analyze, and visualize data. It provides an interactive and dynamic report with embedded code, output, and visualizations, making it ideal for presenting complex data-driven insights.

### Key Features

- *Interactive Notebook*: Combines R code and explanatory text in a single document.
- *Dynamic Outputs*: Generates visualizations and tables inline for easy interpretation.
- *Custom Analysis*: Tailored data analysis specific to the provided dataset and research questions.
- *Reproducibility*: All steps, from data loading to visualization, are reproducible.

## Installation

To use or modify this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   
2. Open the R project file or RStudio session.
3. Install required libraries:
   R
   install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "tidyr", "readr", "knitr", "rmarkdown"))
   

## Usage

1. Open the projectfinalnotebook55.Rmd file in RStudio.
2. Run the notebook interactively or knit it to generate an HTML report.
   - To run interactively, execute code chunks by clicking the play button.
   - To knit the file into an HTML report, click the *Knit* button in RStudio.
3. Review the generated projectfinalnotebook556.nb.html file for insights and visualizations.

### File Structure

- projectfinalnotebook55.Rmd: The main R Markdown notebook containing all the analysis.
- projectfinalnotebook556.nb.html: The rendered HTML report with the analysis outputs.
- data/: Contains the input dataset(s) used for analysis (if applicable).
- scripts/: Any supporting scripts or functions used within the analysis.
- README.md: Documentation for the project.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following R packages:

- dplyr: Data manipulation
- ggplot2: Data visualization
- tidyr: Data tidying
- readr: Data import
- knitr: Report generation
- rmarkdown: Rendering notebooks

Ensure these packages are installed and loaded before running the project.

## Results

The analysis explores the dataset to uncover key patterns and insights. Highlights include:

1. *Summary Statistics*: Overview of the dataset.
2. *Visualizations*: Graphs and plots illustrating relationships and trends.
3. *Custom Analysis*: Specific answers to research questions or hypotheses.

Refer to the projectfinalnotebook556.nb.html file for a detailed report.
